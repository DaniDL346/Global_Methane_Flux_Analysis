# Global Methane Flux Analysis 

**Global Methane Flux Analysis** is a comprehensive data analysis tool designed to streamline Methane Emission data exploration, analysis, and visualisation. The tool supports multiple data formats and provides an intuitive interface for both novice and expert environmental data scientists.

## Dataset Content
The dataset is named "Global Emissions", from [Kaggle]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishraut64/global-methane-emissions). It consists of 9 columns x 1548 rows, it is 620.72 kB in size.<br />


 The nine columns consist of:
  1. Index
  2. region 
  3. country - Country of Emission.
  4. emissions - Methane Emissions in kt.
  5. type - Sector from which emissions occur.
  6. Segment- Sub-sector from which emissions occur.
  7. reason - The reason for the emission.
  8. baseYear - Base year for the tracking of emissions.
  9. notes - The source of data


## Business Requirements
Our mission is to analyse, monitor and reduce the Methane Emissions globally, by monitoring the data sources from Satellite observations and Ennergy and Oil providers. <br />    
Reducing Methane Emissions forms part of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), where over 150 countries pledged to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030. Let us provide you with the data intelligence to help you track and reduce your Methane emission rate.  


## Hypothesis and how to validate?
Investigation Questions:
1. Data trend analysis:
   - How have global methane emissions changed over time?
   - Are methane emissions increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable?
   - Which years saw the largest spike or drop in emissions?
  
2. Geographical insights
   - Which countries or regions contribute the most to methane emissions?
   - How do developed vs. developing countries compare in methane output?
   - What are the top 5 methane-emitting countries in the most recent year?

Per

* List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision validating it (them) 

## Project Plan
* Outline the high-level steps taken for the analysis.
* How was the data managed throughout the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation steps?
* Why did you choose the research methodologies you used?

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations

## Analysis techniques used
* List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
* How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
* Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
* How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Ethical considerations
* Were there any data privacy, bias or fairness issues with the data?
* How did you overcome any legal or societal issues?

## Unfixed Bugs
* Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.
* Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
* If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.

## Development Roadmap
* What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these challenges?
* What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience? 


## Main Data Analysis Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
